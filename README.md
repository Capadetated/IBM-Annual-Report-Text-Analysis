# IBM-Annual-Report-Text-Analysis
A brief textual analysis of IBM's Annual Reports

This Python-based project used Textual Analysis to find patterns within the IBM annual reports to make suggestions for future improvements. The data was taken directly from IBMâ€™s catalogue of published Annual Reports.

"Fitch-Text-Analysis.PDF" contains the full written report on the topic. "NLTK_Fitch_IBM.py" contains the code to perform the analysis. The PDFs of the IBM annual reports for 1999, 2000, 2010, 2019, and 2020 are uploaded here. "words_ibm_annrep_master.csv" contains the dataset formed from the reports used to make the visualizations.
